# RoK-and-Roll

This is a simple automation script for Rise Of Kingdoms (MacOS version). This code was done in a hurry, has a bunch of flaws and many problems.
It does auto scout and troop training, auto reconnection and attempts to bypass the captcha all using image recognition. 
It also implements a way to pause/resume it via terminal and discord webhook and it does send notifications to the webhook and a specified email.

Please use it only to get some ideas as the code is unusable.
